## About the website
Tools I used to build the website: </br>
*Full-stack framework* : asp.net core Razor page. </br>
*Data-base* : Azure SQL Database. <br/>
*Hosting* : Azure. <br />
*Other tools* : Bootstrap 5, Entity framework core, etc.


<br>
<br>

## What I learned 
*About Razor page and asp.net core* : routing with razor page, display template + class model, more middlewares, <br/>
request handlers for multiple forms, passing data between pages using TempData, managing images using webhostEnviroment, <br/>
code reuse with ViewComponent, more tag helpers, client side validation using jQuery and more.

*About database* : First time using SQL in Azure, very convenient. The down side might be the cost. But you get 250GB and 10 dtu for free for a year, so pretty good. 

<br>
<br>


## Epilogue
First time using Razor page, I learned quite a lot building this website. So far you can fully manage the memebers, including all the CRUD operations.
</br> I think I might add a login system and an admin access in the future for safety purpose. </br>




<br/><a href="https://clubchom.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">Go to the website</a> <br/>
*(Please give it 15 to 30 seconds to load the website and database as it is being hosted on free tier Azure, <br>
if you choose to join the club, you don't have to upload a picture if you don't want to, the system will choose a default picture for your account)*
